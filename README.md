# Data_science_project_minial_nobel_prize_winners
The Nobel Prize has been among the most prestigious international awards since 1901. Each year, awards are bestowed in chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. 

The Nobel Foundation has made a dataset available of all prize winners from the outset of the awards from 1901 to 2023. The dataset used in this project is from the Nobel Prize API and is available in the nobel.csv file in the data folder.

It is a small project which was part of my Datacamp course track.

I analyzed the data and identified patterns by answering the following questions:
1. What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?
2. Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize Winners to total winners in all categories?
3.  Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?
4.  Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
5.  Which individual or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?

-'Male' is the most awarded gender and 'United States' is the commonly awarded country.
Marie Curie, nee Sklodowska is the first wooman to receive an award, and also in the 'Physics' category.
